CURRENT
- Spelling fixes?
- Migrate to Netlify
  - Added `netlify.toml`, but it's empty, should be pretty straightforward.
  - Might need to integrate netlify with the github repo

QUESTIONS/THOUGHTS
- I may want to change my URL param ordering, since it makes more sense to have the activity/stepIndex at the end of the URL

Notes
- Initial routes are set in ActivityListing.jsx
- All routes are in routes.jsx
- enums in enums.js
