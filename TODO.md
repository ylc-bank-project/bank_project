CURRENT
- Making "AllAccounts" page neutral for both "AccountOverview" and "MakingPayments" and other activities
  - news flash, it's actually only the footer that needs to be neutral, since we are using the e-transfer tab in the modal.
  - I'm sure there are more things to be learned here.

TODO
- Separate visual components from the activity logic.
	- As needed (no premature optimization)
	- AllAccounts page is used by transfers, so it needs to be separated out.
		- And there are a couple others.
