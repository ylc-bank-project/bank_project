All notes:

We found an online tool that we like and would like to follow: http://obsimulator.halifax.co.uk/digital-playpen/entry/cwa/h/content/56e80838cd93d881ebb4/#/exerciseList

We’d like to set it up like the tool in this link with only 3 activities (exercises) for now:
1.	Accessing your Account- Signing in 
2.	Accounts- online account overview
3.	Making Payments- Pay a new company for the first time



When the user first opens the link, we’d like it to look similar to this tool but YLC logo should be visible and I’d like us to use the same colour scheme as our website. Still thinking about a catchy headline- Choose an activity is too dry. For the description under the headline: “This online banking tool allows you to try out a variety of common online banking tasks. Note: This is an Online Banking simulator and does not manage actual accounts or make real world transactions.” (Not sure if the note should go there or as a disclaimer somewhere else on the page.?)
Then list the categories and activities is the same format below with start buttons. 

The intention of this tool is to use it as a teaching tool so it will be intended for someone who is teaching a person how to use a bank account online. 

Activity #1: Signing In


When you click start from the first screen, a box comes up saying what you’ll do in this exercise. We like how this is set up. We’d like to keep this box the same info minus “and memorable information”. However, for copyright purposes, the wording would have to be changed a little. Then click “start activity button”

From there, you go to Step 1 of 5: Click on ‘sign in’

Step 2 of 5: This is where you enter the 16-digit number from the card you use for debit and ATM transactions. If you don’t have a card, you can use the number you were given at the branch to access Online Banking. If you have set up a username, you can enter it in this field instead of the card number to log in to Online Banking. 
For this activity, enter card # 1234 5678 9098 7654 in the username box. Then select ‘continue’ (button)

Step 3 of 5: This is where you enter the password. When creating your password, use a different password than you use for other websites. Make it difficult for others to guess your password by using a combination of letters and numbers in it. If you think someone knows your password, change it right away.
Do not share your Online Banking password with anyone. Giving your password to another person or company places your finances and privacy at risk.
Never share, disclose, or provide your card number or password to another party or website other than your bank. Your bank will never send you an email requesting this information.

For this activity, enter password: literacy1234 in the password box. 

Step 4 of 5: 
Click this box if you’d like to save your Card number or username on this computer, so you don’t have to enter it again the next time you log in to Online Banking.
We don’t recommend this option if you’re using a public or shared computer.
For this activity, click on the box. Then select ‘continue’ (button)
Step 5 of 5: 
That’s it! You’ve now signed into online banking.
If you have any questions about signing into your bank account online, please contact your bank provider. 
Finish button at bottom to click on. Which takes you to the end box. We like the layout of the end box in the UK simulator but only two options: 1. Repeat Activity button 2. Start New Activity button

Activity #2: Account overview
When you click start for this activity, a box comes up saying what you’ll do in this exercise. We like how this is set up. ‘In this exercise we’ll guide you through viewing an online back account’

Box comes up pointing to the word ‘balance’ in the account saying- Balance shows the amount of money in your account, including any funds on hold. Continue button

Go to Account information

Box comes up pointing to the word ‘Overdraft limit’ in the account saying- Overdraft Limit is the maximum amount of money you can withdraw from your account after your balance reaches zero. Continue button

Box comes up pointing to the word ‘Available Funds’ in the account saying- Available Funds is your balance minus any funds on hold plus any overdraft limit (if applicable), representing money available for immediate use in your account. Continue button

Box comes up pointing to the word ‘Institution #’ in the account saying- An institution number is a 3- digit code that identifies which bank provider the account is associated with. Continue button
